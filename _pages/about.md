Hi, I'm Sean.
 One of the main motivations behind the Gen Z Guide to Bitcoin blog was to 
 provide my fellow Gen Zâ€™ers with a great source of rich and digestible content regarding 
 bitcoin and the cryptocurrency world. While the title of this blog 
 singles out Gen-Z, I write my blog posts with the intention that anyone from any age bracket
 should be able to comprehend and learn from this site if that's what they desire.
