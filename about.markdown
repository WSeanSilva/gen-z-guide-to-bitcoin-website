Hi, my name’s Seraphim! I tend to talk alot about finance, bitcoin, model-building, and history with 
friends and family, so to give their ears a break I decided to build this website.
I’m a graduate from the Eller College of Management at The University of Arizona with a BSBA 
in finance. One of my main motivations behind the Gen Z Guide to Bitcoin blog was to 
 provide my fellow Gen Z’ers with a great source of rich and digestible content regarding 
 mainly bitcoin, but also personal finance and wealth. While the title of this blog 
 single out Gen-Z, I write my blog posts with the intention that anyone from every age 
 should be able to comprehend and learn from this site. Thanks for visiting, HODL on!
